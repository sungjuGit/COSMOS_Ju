Windows: Note: for some users on Windows 11, Microsoft Defender is blocking installation because it thinks it detects a virus. Here's a work-around: (a) right-click the downloaded installer and choose "Show more options", then "Scan with Microsoft Defender", (b) click on "Allowed threats", then "Protection history" (c) exempt the Tracker installer under "Actions." You should then be able to run the installer. 
 
Mac OS: Double-click the file to mount and open the disk image with installer app Tracker-6.x.x-osx-installer.app. To run the installer file, control-click it and choose Open from the popup menu.
